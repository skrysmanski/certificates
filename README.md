# Certificates Documentation
This repository contains documentation (in form of Markdown files) regarding everything related to certificates. It'll evolve as I gain more insight into certificates and is primarily a notebook for myself.

Information in this repo may not be correct (as I'm no expert on that matter), so use it at your own risk.
